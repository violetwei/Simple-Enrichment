# Simple-Enrichment

### Description
Implement a general purpose application to enrich an input stream of records with an external data source. Use three design patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Strategy.

Use Eclipse to import as a maven project.

### TypeSafe Configuration Library

A basic requirement of implementing a general purpose application is to use configuration to pass different properties. [TypeSafe config library](https://github.com/lightbend/config) has proven itself a powerful player in this area. It also uses a special document type called HOCON.
